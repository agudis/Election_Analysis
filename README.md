2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election Audit Summary 
The script that we have created to complete this audit, could easily be modified and used in the future. I suggest that the election commission take this into consideration to analyze future elections. You could use the same structure of this code to set different variables and create more if loops to analyze additional data such as questions regarding county elected officials. You could also modify the script by adding in information to calculate the Electoral College. By making these modifications you could use this script in many different elections.
